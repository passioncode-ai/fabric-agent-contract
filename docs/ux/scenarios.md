## Personas

Canonical personas are defined in [foundation.md](foundation.md): P-01
independent agent author and P-02 project operator.

## Authoring

### SCN-001: Choose and validate a compatible profile

- **Persona:** P-01
- **Feature:** authoring
- **Traces:** ST-001, FLW-01 (JTBD-01, JRN-01/#2, JRN-01/#3)
- **Entry point:** README profile chooser or direct profile link
- **Preconditions:** provider has an MCP, A2A or local-runner interface
- **Steps:**
  1. Author identifies how the provider communicates -> contract names the matching profile and the boundary it owns.
  2. Author fills the minimal manifest -> validator evaluates common and profile-specific fields separately.
  3. Author runs conformance -> report shows shape and protocol verdicts without claiming semantic admission.
- **Expected result:** author has a valid declaration and knows the remaining semantic admission gate.
- **Alt paths:** direct profile entry -> profile page links back to common objects and version policy.
- **UI elements:** profile table, schema link, example, conformance gate list.
- **States covered:** loading, error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** unresolved schema or unsupported protocol revision -> report names the exact reference or revision and supported alternatives.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

### SCN-002: Correct an invalid or incompatible declaration

- **Persona:** P-01
- **Feature:** authoring
- **Traces:** ST-001, FLW-01 (JTBD-01, JRN-01/#3)
- **Entry point:** failed conformance report
- **Preconditions:** at least one gate failed
- **Steps:**
  1. Author reads the first failing gate -> report shows instance path, rule and safe recovery action.
  2. Author corrects the declaration and reruns -> unchanged gates remain comparable and corrected gate is reevaluated.
- **Expected result:** failure is corrected or remains explicitly scoped; no provider access is granted by retrying.
- **Alt paths:** author keeps an older protocol revision -> host reports incompatibility rather than silently translating it.
- **UI elements:** failed gate, instance path, recovery action, evidence link.
- **States covered:** error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** malformed evidence URI -> report rejects the report itself and points to the conformance schema.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

## Admission and binding

### SCN-003: Admit before binding

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** admission
- **Traces:** ST-002, FLW-02 (JTBD-02, JRN-02/#1)
- **Entry point:** discovered provider record
- **Preconditions:** provider declaration is shape-valid
- **Steps:**
  1. Operator inspects identity and protocol negotiation -> admission record shows each independent verdict.
  2. Host runs semantic probes -> record links probe inputs, scoped outputs and evidence.
  3. Operator attempts binding -> host permits it only when admission is accepted and current.
- **Expected result:** only an admitted provider revision can become a project binding.
- **Alt paths:** admission expired or provider suspended -> existing run pins remain readable but new bindings are denied.
- **UI elements:** identity verdict, protocol verdict, probe verdict, admission status, expiry.
- **States covered:** loading, error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** identity or probe failure -> rejection names the failed gate and a new provider revision may be submitted.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

### SCN-004: Reject an unsafe project context

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** binding
- **Traces:** ST-003, FLW-02 (JTBD-02, JRN-02/#2)
- **Entry point:** proposed project binding
- **Preconditions:** provider is admitted
- **Steps:**
  1. Operator selects an execution context and optional per-agent account -> validator resolves references without reading secret values.
  2. Validator compares account to the pinned project pool -> out-of-pool account is denied.
  3. Validator inspects environment declaration -> embedded credential or unrestricted ambient environment is denied.
- **Expected result:** unsafe context never becomes an active binding and the valid input remains available for correction.
- **Alt paths:** selected account is unavailable -> only a versioned fallback entry from the same project pool may be used and the switch is recorded.
- **UI elements:** context revision, pool revision, account reference, denial reason.
- **States covered:** error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** pool depleted -> run pauses with an explicit capability-unavailable result; operator may approve a new pool revision.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

### SCN-005: Bind an admitted capability

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** binding
- **Traces:** ST-002, ST-003, FLW-02 (JTBD-02, JRN-02/#2)
- **Entry point:** accepted admission record
- **Preconditions:** provider, context, policy, checker and grants validate
- **Steps:**
  1. Operator selects capability and project role or node scope -> binding shows every immutable revision reference.
  2. Operator validates the proposal -> host verifies admission, allowlist, context, grant and checker.
  3. Operator records the binding -> new runs may pin it while existing runs remain unchanged.
- **Expected result:** a content-addressed binding can be reproduced without ambient state.
- **Alt paths:** optional specialist is absent -> project shows a capability gap; CEO, product manager and developer cardinalities remain valid.
- **UI elements:** capability, scope, revision references, content hash, validation result.
- **States covered:** empty, error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** any stale reference -> binding rejected with the replacement revision expected.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

## Recovery

### SCN-006: Recover through a new revision

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** recovery
- **Traces:** ST-004, FLW-03 (JTBD-03, JRN-02/#4, JRN-02/#5)
- **Entry point:** failed result, suspended provider or version history
- **Preconditions:** a prior run or configuration revision exists
- **Steps:**
  1. Operator inspects DONE, PROOF, SCOPE and NOT VERIFIED -> result separates verified facts from unknowns.
  2. Operator selects replacement, rollback basis or permitted pool fallback -> policy validates the choice.
  3. Host creates a new revision or switch event -> prior revisions and run pins remain unchanged.
- **Expected result:** future work uses the recovered configuration and prior work remains reproducible.
- **Alt paths:** no known-good revision exists -> operator creates a fresh proposal rather than a false rollback.
- **UI elements:** result envelope, evidence links, revision diff, basis, switch event.
- **States covered:** empty, partial, error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** recovery candidate fails validation -> proposal remains inactive with its findings preserved.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

## Learning

### SCN-007: Produce a governed learning proposal

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** learning
- **Traces:** ST-005, FLW-04 (JTBD-03, JRN-02/#6)
- **Entry point:** failed checker or repeated-stage loop guard
- **Preconditions:** failed attempt is recorded
- **Steps:**
  1. Agent records failed attempt and hypothesized cause -> retro preserves evidence and scope.
  2. Independent checker verifies a correction -> retro links the contrasting result.
  3. Agent proposes a new setting revision -> active prompt, policy, pipeline and checker remain unchanged.
  4. Product manager approves a project-scoped proposal -> host creates a new revision for future runs.
- **Expected result:** learning is contrast-based, approved and applied only through a new revision.
- **Alt paths:** same stage entered a third time without changed hypothesis -> loop guard pauses the node and asks for a new plan or decision.
- **UI elements:** failed attempt, correction, causal claim, scope, approver, proposed revision.
- **States covered:** empty, error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** missing verified correction or self-mutation target -> proposal denied with required evidence named.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

### SCN-008: Deny unsafe global promotion

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** learning
- **Traces:** ST-005, FLW-04 (JTBD-03, JRN-02/#6)
- **Entry point:** proposed cross-project insight
- **Preconditions:** a project-scoped learning exists
- **Steps:**
  1. Agent proposes promotion -> policy evaluates classification, anonymization, provenance and conflicts.
  2. CEO reviews independent evidence -> missing independence or unresolved conflict keeps the insight project-local.
  3. CEO approves a safe proposal -> global insight links source project evidence without copying raw sensitive content.
- **Expected result:** only anonymized, independently supported insights become global memory.
- **Alt paths:** CEO rejects the promotion -> project learning remains valid and rejection rationale is preserved.
- **UI elements:** classification, provenance, conflicts, independent evidence, approval decision.
- **States covered:** error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** personal, credential or regulated raw content -> promotion denied; author may propose a new anonymized insight revision.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** none yet
- **Product:** unobserved

## Routing

### SCN-009: Serve a request through the next available runner

- **Persona:** P-02
- **Feature:** routing
- **Traces:** ST-006, FLW-05 (JTBD-02, JTBD-03, JRN-02/#2, JRN-02/#5)
- **Entry point:** an agent chat or a task bound to a capability of the local-runner profile
- **Preconditions:** the project pins a runner route whose candidates are admitted and catalogued
- **Steps:**
  1. Operator starts a chat -> the host walks the route from the first candidate.
  2. The first candidate is `claude-code` with `{attach: preferred, spawn: never}` and the host holds no session of it -> it is passed over as `no-held-session`.
  3. The next candidates are probed with the catalogue's version argv -> a signed-out runner is `not-connected`, a missing one `not-installed`.
  4. Hermes answers its probe and `spawn` is `allowed` -> the host spawns it under the derived execution context and records `runner-selected`.
- **Expected result:** the chat is answered by Hermes; the event names the route revision, the selection and why each candidate above it was passed over; scopes, limits and permissions are those of the binding.
- **Alt paths:** a held Claude Code session of this project exists -> it is attached and no process starts; the running runner fails later -> the next launch walks again and records `runner-switched` with `runner-failed`.
- **UI elements:** route revision, candidate list with session policy, selection, probe results, switch event.
- **States covered:** empty, partial, error, success
- **Errors & recovery:** every candidate passed over -> capability-unavailable with every probe result, under `exhausted: hold` after waiting at most `limits.wallSeconds`; the operator signs a runner in or edits the route as a new revision.
- **Status:** validated
- **Coverage:** `test/route-rules.test.ts` (FAC-SEM-028…034), fixtures `runner-route*`
- **Product:** unobserved
